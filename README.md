## Description
This is a back-end application that encapsulates important topics of building APIs. This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This app specifically uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation
In order to get this app up and running and once the code is visible, you'll want to open an integrated terminal in VS Code. In order to install all of the required dependencies for the app, you'll next run "npm i". One this process is over, the last command you'll run is "npm run start", which will kick-start the server and allow it to be accessed at http://localhost:3001.

## Usage
This app is meant to mirror certain aspects of a social network app. Using specific routes/endpoints that were created in the routes folder will allow a user to access certain information about a user, their thoughts, or reactions to those thoughts, as well as update and delete thoughts and reactions. In order to fully understand and visualize the functionality of this app, use Insomnia to access all of the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
